# Exoplanet Sample Data for SpaceCanva Laboratory Testing
# This CSV contains sample exoplanet transit data for testing the CSV upload functionality
# 
# Column Descriptions:
# mission: Space mission that collected the data (kepler, k2, tess)
# period: Orbital period in days
# duration: Transit duration in hours
# depth: Transit depth in parts per million (ppm)
# impact: Impact parameter (0 = central transit, >1 = grazing/false positive)
# snr: Signal-to-noise ratio
# steff: Stellar effective temperature in Kelvin
# srad: Stellar radius in solar radii (Râ˜‰)
# slogg: Stellar surface gravity in dex
# tmag: TESS magnitude
#
# Data Format: mission,period,duration,depth,impact,snr,steff,srad,slogg,tmag
